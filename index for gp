   <h1>GP Project-Redmi Note 9</h1>
    We (7 grade of Legacy school Bangalore) were assigned a project to find out a phone where the budget was ₹15,000. This project was given to us as there is a pandemic amidst us (2020), all  classes are currently conducted online and not everybody can afford a phone or laptop but, ₹15,000  is an affordable budget.
     <br><br>
     The phone that I have chosen is the Redmi note 9. Which is just ₹500 lesser than our budget. The is a fierce competitor in the budget flagship market. This Phone is just amazing for its price. It has an excellent camera, 1080x2340 pixel display and comes with an Octacore processor. It also has amazing battery life up to 13 hours of gaming, 26 hours of video playback and 9 hours of HD video recording. It has a 18 watt charger which takes 2 hours and 15 minutes to charge to 100%. It also has a stylus.

     <p><ins>Price<p><ins>
     <br>
     <p><normal>The price is not as expensive as other flagship phones but, has the capability to sell better than one of them. It has a price tag that most people can likely afford.<p><normal>
    <p><ins>Camera<p><ins>
    <p><normal>The Redmi Note 9 has a quad camera setup. Which is the setup for modern phones. It has a 48-megapixel primary camera, 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera, 2-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, it has a 13-megapixel camera in the front. <p><normal>
    <p><ins>Display<p><ins>
    <p><normal>The Redmi Note 9 has a 6.53 inch (16.5862 Centimetres). It’s display type is IPS LCD. It has a touchscreen display. It has ultra HD display which has 1080x2340.<p><normal>
    <br>
    <p><ins>Battery<p><ins>
    <p><normal>The battery is a really key feature for a good phone. It is also very important as people might be spending their salaries to afford this phone and their money needs to be spent on a good phone. The battery is pretty big coming at 5020 mAh. It takes a lot of time to drain the battery. For example: if a child is doing online classes, he will have to study more than just the online class. This way battery life helps a lot.<p><normal>
    <br>
    <p><ins>Stylus <p><ins>
    <p><normal>I felt the stylus was really important as if a student needs to annotate even this feature would be there.<p><normal>
    <p><ins>Conclusion <p><ins>
    <p><normal>This project really brings awareness about how many people do not have enough money for the gadgets used for online school. A phone is a really important item for everyday life in the world that we currently live in and not everybody can afford such a luxury. I really loved doing this project. One of the reasons is I had coded this website for the first time completely. <p><normal>
